# The runner is the shared `doctest` CLI
# (https://github.com/logos-co/logos-doctest), invoked directly via its flake.
# For each *.test.yaml in this directory, `doctest run` executes every command in

# and asserts on the output; `doctest generate` renders the same spec to Markdown
# under outputs/ (gitignored — the *.test.yaml spec is the source of truth).
